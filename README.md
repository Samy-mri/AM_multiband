Optimized amplitude modulated Multiband RF pulse design
Design AM Multiband pulses using modified versions of Phase-optimization (Wong 2012), Time-shifting (Auerbach 2013) and Root-flipping (Sharma 2016) to produce AM-only pulses.
Each pulse design method is contained within a folder with a main function (phaseopt_fn, timeshift_fn and rootflip_fn).
Running the script Design_Multiband.m designs Normal or AM-only pulses using the three methods and plots the RF pulses and slice profiles.

This requires the following:
*  CVX from (http://cvxr.com/cvx/).
*  Pauly's RF tools from (http://rsl.stanford.edu/research/software.html).
