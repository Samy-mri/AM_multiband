# AM_multiband
Simple optimization to compute slice phase offsets for multi-band RF pulses. This work was presented at ISMRM 2015, program number 2398.

The script MB_optimal_phase.m can be used to compute optimized slice phase offsets for reducing peak pulse amplitudes for any number of excited slices (multi band factor, MBF). The script can be used for full complex modulation (AM/FM) or just AM which is the subject of the poster referenced above. For more information you can download the submitted abstract from here
